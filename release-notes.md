# Release Notes — Radware SecurePath Connector for Azure API Management

---

## v1.3.2 (2026-05-03) — Current

**Bug fix.** Corrects `x-rdwr-o2v-bytes-sent` reporting in the response-phase log to match NGINX `$bytes_sent` semantics.

### Bug Fixes

- **`x-rdwr-o2v-bytes-sent` now reports total wire bytes** (status line + serialized response headers + body), not body length alone. Before this fix the field equalled `x-rdwr-o2v-body-bytes-sent`, which under-reported actual response size by the size of the response headers. The XML allow-path expression now sums `~20` bytes for the status line approximation, every response header serialized as `Name: Value\r\n`, the final empty-line CRLF (`2` bytes), and the body length. `x-rdwr-o2v-body-bytes-sent` continues to report body bytes only, matching NGINX `$body_bytes_sent`.

### Sideband Plugin Info

- `x-rdwr-plugin-info` default updated to `700-v1.3.2`.

### Deployment

Same XML policy file (`rdwr-azureapim-securepath-connector-v1.3.xml`). No new Named Values required. Existing deployments can upgrade by replacing the policy XML in place via `az apim api policy update` or the Azure Portal.

## v1.3.1 (2026-03-31)

**Bug fix and analytics enhancement.** Adds connector disposition reporting in the response-phase log, enables response-phase logging on block and redirect verdicts, and corrects large-body forwarding behavior.

### Bug Fixes
- **Large request body forwarding.** When `Content-Length` exceeded `rdwr-body-max-size-bytes`, the policy previously forwarded the full body to SecurePath instead of skipping it. The policy now correctly sends an empty body in that case, preserving the configured size limit.

### Enhancements
- **Connector disposition header.** The response-phase log POST now includes `x-rdwr-o2h-rdwr-response`, with value:
  - `allowed` — the request reached the origin backend
  - `blocked` — the connector blocked or redirected the request
  
  This enables the SecurePath portal to report which requests actually reached origin.
- **Response-phase log on all verdict paths.** The response-phase log now fires on allow, block, and redirect verdicts (previously only on allow). This gives full analytics visibility for traffic that never reaches the origin.

### Sideband Plugin Info
- `x-rdwr-plugin-info` default updated to `700-v1.3.1`.

### Deployment
Same XML policy file (`rdwr-azureapim-securepath-connector-v1.3.xml`). No new Named Values required. Existing deployments can upgrade by replacing the policy XML in place.

## v1.3.0 (2026-03-12)

**General availability.** Full feature parity with the reference NGINX connector. Adds asynchronous response-phase logging via `send-one-way-request`, complete sideband header assembly, and a customisable block page.

### Features
- **XML policy-based architecture.** No custom C# code; all SecurePath logic is implemented as Azure APIM XML policies.
- **Complete sideband header assembly.** All mandatory `x-rdwr-*` headers (`x-rdwr-app-id`, `x-rdwr-api-key`, `x-rdwr-connector-ip`, `x-rdwr-true-client-ip`, `x-rdwr-host`, `x-rdwr-connector-port`, `x-rdwr-connector-scheme`, `x-rdwr-plugin-info`, `x-rdwr-connector-proto`, `x-rdwr-connector-stage`).
- **Verdict enforcement.** Allow, block (HTML and JSON), 301/302 redirect, challenge, true-bypass.
- **Bot Manager integration.** Bot Manager cookie and header propagation on all verdict paths.
- **Response-phase logging (v2).** Fire-and-forget log POST via `send-one-way-request`, correlated by `x-rdwr-oop-id`. Captures origin response metadata; mode 3 includes a base64-encoded body sample.
- **Reserved header security.** Strips spoofed `x-rdwr-*` headers from incoming client requests (returns 403).
- **Static resource bypass.** Configurable file extensions and HTTP methods skip sideband entirely.
- **Fail-open by default.** Traffic flows to backend if SecurePath is unreachable.
- **Custom block page.** Configurable HTML/JSON block page rendered on block verdict, with transaction ID extraction.

### Platform Notes
- **No JavaScript injection.** Azure APIM XML policies cannot modify response bodies; the `inject_js` verdict is treated as `allow`. This is an APIM platform constraint, not a connector limitation. Practical impact is minimal for API gateway traffic (typically JSON/XML).
- **`x-rdwr-connector-scheme` always `https`.** Azure APIM forces HTTPS termination; the scheme value reflects this.
- **Partial body format.** APIM forwards a truncated body when oversize is detected; reference connectors may instead send `Content-Length: 0`. Both are valid SecurePath inputs.

### Sideband Plugin Info
- `x-rdwr-plugin-info` value: `700-v1.3.0`. Platform code `700` identifies this connector as the Azure API Management variant.

### Deployment
Deploy the XML policy file (`rdwr-azureapim-securepath-connector-v1.3.xml`) to your APIM instance via the Azure Portal or `az apim api policy create-or-update`. Configure all required Named Values before applying the policy. See `README.md` for the complete onboarding walkthrough.

### Requirements
- Azure API Management instance (any tier: Developer, Basic, Standard, Premium, v2)
- A SecurePath application provisioned in the [Radware Cloud portal](https://portal.radwarecloud.com)
- Outbound HTTPS connectivity (port 443) from APIM to `*.oop.radwarecloud.net`
